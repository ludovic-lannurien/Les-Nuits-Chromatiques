# Les-Nuits-Chromatiques


5 developers joined forces to develop a website dedicated to a light and music festival. 
This project remains fictional. 

We used React for the frontend and Symfony for the backend. 

Les Nuits Chromatiques is Dijon's event dedicated to light scenography and contemporary music, in the heart of the city centre and its architectural heritage, classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
The festival is a new interpretation of the city, highlighting the historical heritage of Dijon and expressing the city's electronic scene.
